            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Sounds of Silence emerged from profound personal loss and an unwavering commitment to break the silence surrounding mental illness. Our story began in 2008 when sisters Lisa Reilly and Erin Mascaro established the Sounds of Silence Run to support the Postpartum Resource Center of New York (PRCNY), inspired by Lisa's own battle with perinatal and postpartum depression. United in purpose, they made a powerful pact: to shatter the silence of suffering, celebrate resilient families, and build lasting hope for all those facing mental health challenges.
                As the Run grew and touched more lives, tragedy struck. In 2014, Lisa lost her battle with depression, and in 2018, their sister Susanne also succumbed to mental illness. These devastating losses only strengthened Erin Mascaro and her family to ensure that no one faces mental illness alone.

                Mental illness knows no boundaries—it touches people of all backgrounds, manifesting in countless ways. We understand deeply that no family should navigate these challenges without support. Building on our founding mission, Sounds of Silence has evolved beyond our initial focus on postpartum depression to encompass all aspects of mental health.

                Our mission remains beautifully simple yet profound: to inspire hope, foster a supportive community, connect people to vital resources, encourage self-care, and break the silence that shrouds mental illness. We believe in the power of open dialogue, the importance of asking "Are you okay?", and the strength in supporting one another. Through these actions, we work to dissolve stigma and light the way for individuals and families on their mental health journeys.
                Today, we amplify these vital conversations through our signature Sounds of Silence Run, strategic partnerships with mental health organizations, and our innovative student advocacy program. We envision a world where mental illness no longer lives in shadows—where seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness, and where mental health stands equal with physical well-being in both priority and practice.

                Through every step of this journey, we honor Lisa and Susanne's legacy by transforming personal tragedy into communal hope, ensuring their story continues to inspire positive change in countless lives and remind all we are worth the work of self-care. 
                Take Care of You.
